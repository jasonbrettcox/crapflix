this is a basic movie search app that connects to the Online Move Database (OMDB).  The unique feature of this app is that it allows people to search for bad movies - thus the name, ShitFlix. 

Many times I want a movie that i don't have to pay much attention to. Maybe I'm not feeling well and know I'll just fall asleep anyways. Perhaps I just want some background music, or I'm tired and don't want anything actually has a plot. This app allows you to search those kinds of movies by upending the normal search-by-ratings function. 

In this app, poorly rated movies are returned first. Stretch goals include the ability to search specifically for straight-to-video releases and to search by actors known for shit fils, such as Steve Gutenberg or Jon Travolta.
